Description
Adds time of membership and guild bank depositions/withdrawals (gold only) to 
the guild roster tooltips. 

This addon adds some information to the standard guild roster tooltips:
- Days since a member joined
- Amount of gold that a member deposited on / withdrawed from the guild bank

When the addon is run for the very first time, it needs to download all 
information from the server first. This needs to be done only one time and may 
take some minutes. NOTE: If you're running other addons, that request guild 
histories (like Shopkeeper or Master Merchant) you might get booted from the 
server because of spam. In that case, I suggest to disable those addons for this 
first scan.

After the initial scan, all further scans are done periodically every 5 minutes 
to keep the information up to date.

* This addon does not have an in game settings menu currently. I am planning 
on adding in on addition to some other features in the future as time permits.
